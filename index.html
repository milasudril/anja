<h2 id="intro"><span class="fill">1</span> Introduction</h2><p><strong>Anja</strong> is a sample player designed for live sound effect playback. Anja makes it possible to assign sound effects to the keys typing keys of the computer keyboard. To make it easier to find sound effects, each sound effect can have a description and a color, that shows up on Anja's virtual computer keyboard.</p>

	<p>Anja also features a channel mixer with 16 channels. All sound effects are routed through one of these channels. The channel mixer makes it possible to fade a group of sound effects together. As with sound effects, each channel has a color and a description. In addition to color, description and channel gain, each channel also has an adjustable fade time, that is used to automatically fade the channel.</p>

	<p>The backend of Anja is JACK, the low-latency audio server&#160;<cite><a href="#jack">[1]</a></cite>. This makes it possible to connect Anja to other JACK clients enabling the creation of more complex signal flows.</p>

	<p>The session file format of Anja is in a formalized text format, optimized for human readability. The syntax of the session files has taken inspiration from formats such as Markdown&#160;<cite><a href="#markdown">[2]</a></cite> and is very similar to the syntax used in the "Doom template file"&#160;<cite><a href="#doomwiki">[3]</a></cite>. Therefore, session files can be easiliy edited by hand in a text editor, to the price of somewhat larger session files.</p>


	<h3 id="requirements"><span class="fill">1.1</span>System requirements</h3><p>To run Anja, a working installation of JACK&#160;<cite><a href="#jack">[1]</a></cite> is required. Moreover, Anja requires <code>libsndfile</code> and <code>GTK+</code> version 3. Anja currently only builds on x86-64. Since Anja completely loads all sound files referenced from a session file, it may consume some RAM. At 48&#160;kHz, the RAM usage is 11&#160;MiB/min of sound. The minimum screen resolution for running Anja is 1024&#160;px × 768&#160;px.</p>


	<h3 id="comparison"><span class="fill">1.2</span>Anja compared to other software</h3><p>There are other sample players that also may be used with JACK. One such program is Hydrogen&#160;<cite><a href="#hydrogen">[4]</a></cite>. Compared to Hydrogen, Anja lacks a sequencer. However, in Hydrogen, waveforms need to be assigned in a particular order, and Hydrogen does not feature an on-screen keyboard. Other features in Anja is event-triggerd auto-fade, and also an exposed <em>kill all</em> feature.</p>

	<h2 id="install"><span class="fill">2</span> Installing Anja</h2><p>Before Anja can be used, the program needs to be installed. This chapter goes through the installation procedure.</p>

	<h3 id="installlinux"><span class="fill">2.1</span>Installing on a GNU/Linux system</h3><p>On GNU/Linux, the recommended way of installing Anja is to install it from the software repository. If there is no package available, download the source package&#160;<cite><a href="#anjasrc">[5]</a></cite>, and compile it as according to the instructions in <a href="#compile">Section 2.2</a>.</p>

	<h3 id="compile"><span class="fill">2.2</span>Compiling Anja</h3><p>Before Anja can be compiled, certain programs, and libraries are needed. These are listed in <a href="#deps">Appendix G</a>. Observe that some of the libraries may be split into a runtime package, and a development package. In this case you must install both parts of the library. On Ubuntu, these packages usually have the suffix <em>dev</em>. Anja has been written using the <code>maike</code> build tool. Therefore, this program has to be available when Anja is compiled. The <dfn>makefile</dfn> distributed with Anja, tries to detect <code>maike</code> before the compilation starts. If the <dfn>makefile</dfn> fails to detect <code>maike</code>, a package containing <code>maike</code> is downloaded from the author's GitHub repository by using <code>wget</code> and <code>jq</code>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, the Anja source package can be obtained from&#160;<cite><a href="#anjasrc">[5]</a></cite>. Following this link gives a link to a gzipped tarball. In order to extract that tarball issue the command</p>

	<pre><code class="bash">tar -xf anja-src.tar.gz</code></pre>

	<p>This will create a directory <code>anja</code>, in current directory. Now <code>cd</code> into that directory and run <code>make</code>:</p>

	<pre><code class="bash">cd anja-src
make</code></pre>

<p>When running <code>make</code>, files are written to <code>__targets_rel</code>. After the compilation has completed, Anja can be launched directly by running the command</p>
<pre><code class="bash">__targets_rel/anja</code></pre>

<div class="infobox_warning ">
<info-content>
<picture>
<source srcset="message_warning.svg">
<img src="message_warning.gif" alt="warning">
</picture>
<div>Normally, Anja is distributed with pre-rendered images. It may happen that the corresponding <code>blender</code> file has been updated and the render. In this case, it will take a much longer time than normal to compile Anja, since the images will need to be rerendered.</div>
</info-content></div>

	<p>To make it easier to launch Anja, you can move it to a place mentioned in the <code>PATH</code> variable. For example, if you have <code>sudo</code> permissions, you can do</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo mv __targets_rel/anja /usr/local/bin</code></pre>
<p>If you do not have <code>sudo</code> permissions, you can move it to <code>~/bin</code> instead:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">mv __targets_rel/anja ~/bin</code></pre>

	<h2 id="using"><span class="fill">3</span> Using Anja</h2><p>Starting Anja brings up a window that looks like the one presented in <a href="#anjastart">Figure 3.1</a>. The workspace consists of four main parts outlined in <a href="#anjaworkspace">Figure 3.2</a>. At the top, there is a <dfn>status area</dfn>, showing the state of Anja. Below that, there are two columns. The leftmost column contains the <dfn>action panel</dfn> with different buttons that affect Anja's current state. To the right of that, the <dfn>keyboard view</dfn> is located, and below that, there is a <dfn>settings panel</dfn>, controlling which waveforms are loaded as well as the playback of loaded waveforms.</p>

To the left is the <dfn>action panel</dfn>, used to control Anja's state. To the right is the <dfn>keyboard view</dfn>, which selects waveform slots and channels, and below that is the <dfn>settings panel</dfn>, which is used to load waveforms and control the playback of loaded waveforms.</p></figure><h3 id="statusarea"><span class="fill">3.1</span>The status area</h3><p>The <dfn>status area</dfn>, shown larger in <a href="#statusareacut">Figure 3.3</a>, contains four parts as illustrated by <a href="#statusareafig">Figure 3.4</a>. The engine status and the keyboard status indicators should be self-explanatory: red <img src="led_stop.png" alt="led_stop.png"> means that it is not ready, and green <img src="led_ready.png" alt="led_ready.png"> that it is ready. A similar convention holds for the <dfn>port status area</dfn> (see <a href="#chstatus">Appendix A</a> for more details). In addition to being in the state of usable or not usable, ports are of different types: MIDI or Wave, input or output. MIDI ports have red-shaded background, while Wave ports have a blue-shaded background. Input ports are located to the left, and output ports are located to the right. Between the input and output sections, there are indicators with neutral or non-highlighted background. These represent the 16 internal Wave ports.</p>

The amount of memory used by other processes uses low-saturated colors. The level indicator is divided into two parts: RAM and swap. The RAM part is green, while the swap part is red.</p>

<div>You do <em>not</em> want Anja to spill over into the swap space, since it can result in long delays between pressing triggering playback, and actual sound output. Also, it can result in sound dropout from other processes running on the same JACK server.</div>
</info-content></div>

<h3 id="addfx"><span class="fill">3.2</span>Loading a waveform</h3><p>To load a waveform, choose a slot by clicking on the corresponding key in the <dfn>keyboard view</dfn> (see <a href="#anjaworkspace">Figure 3.2</a>). It is possible to choose any typing key except system keys and the space bar. After choosing a key <kbd><var>K</var></kbd>, the corresponding key will be highlighted. Now click <ui-button>Browse…</ui-button> to the right of <ui-formfield>Source</ui-formfield> field now visible in the <dfn>settings panel</dfn> (see <a href="#anjastart">Figure 3.1</a>). This brings up a file selection dialog. It is also possible to type a filename directly in the text input field to the left of <ui-button>Browse…</ui-button>.</p>

	<div class="infobox_info ">
<info-content>
<picture>
<source srcset="message_info.svg">
<img src="message_info.gif" alt="info">
</picture>
<div>In case a multi-channel audio file is loaded, only the data for the first (usually the "left" channel) will be loaded. This is because Anja uses mono waveforms. What you would do, is to separate the channels of the input file with a tool such as <code>ffmpeg</code> and load the resulting tracks into different slots, mapped to different channels. Then use multi-channel output (see <a href="#multichannel">Section 3.7</a>) and trigger playback of these slots simultaneously.
	</div>
</info-content></div>

	<h3 id="play"><span class="fill">3.3</span>Playing waveforms</h3><p>Before any sound can be heard from Anja, the following conditions has to be met:</p>

	<ul><li>The <dfn>audio engine</dfn> has to be running</li>
	<li>The output of Anja has to be connected to a suitable system playback port</li>
	<li>The corresponding playback channel has to be unmuted, and have a non-zero gain. For more information, see <a href="#pbchannel">Section 3.5.4</a> and <a href="#chmixer">Section 3.6</a>.</li>
	<li>The workspace must accept keyboard input (see <a href="#keybstatus">Section 3.3.3</a>), or the MIDI input port must be connected to a MIDI event source (see <a href="#midi">Section 3.8</a>)</li></ul>

<h4 id="engstatus"><span class="fill">3.3.1</span>Controlling and manipulating engine status</h4><p>As stated in <a href="#statusarea">Section 3.1</a>, the state of the engine is showed by the leftmost panel in the <dfn>status area</dfn>. If a JACK server was already running when Anja was started, the engine should be running already. Otherwise, make sure that there is a JACK server running, and click the button <ui-button>Start engine</ui-button> in the <dfn>action panel</dfn> (see <a href="#anjaworkspace">Figure 3.2</a>). Now, there should be a new JACK client with a name that derived from the name of the current Anja session. For example, after starting the engine on the default session, there should be a JACK client called <code>New session.anja</code>.</p>

<h4 id="connections"><span class="fill">3.3.2</span>Connecting Anja to system playback</h4><p>By default, Anja has two output ports: <code>Master out</code> and <code>Audition</code>. The difference between these ports is what sound that are routed to them. <code>Master out</code> is the main output, in the sense that all playback triggered by regular key input and MIDI (see <a href="#midi">Section 3.8</a>) will be routed to this port. The <code>Audition</code> port is used for playback of the current slot (in <a href="#addfx">Section 3.2</a> the slot mapped to key <kbd><var>K</var></kbd>), triggered by hitting <kbd>Space</kbd>.</p>

	<div class="infobox_info ">

<source srcset="message_info.svg">
<img src="message_info.gif" alt="info">

<div>
	Notice that hitting <kbd>Space</kbd> bar will never output any sound to <code>Master out</code>. This makes it possible to pre-listen to sounds without routing them to a PA system.
	</div>
</info-content></div>

<p>The connection status of <code>Master out</code> and <code>Audition</code> is shown by the two indicators with blue-shaded background in the output section of the <dfn>port status area</dfn> (see <a href="#statusareacut">Figure 3.3</a> and <a href="#statusareafig">Figure 3.4</a>). When the engine is not running, these are black <img src="led_off.png" alt="led_off.png">. When the engine is running, a non-connected port is indicated by a yellow <img src="led_wait.png" alt="led_wait.png"> light, and a connected port is indicated by a green <img src="led_ready.png" alt="led_ready.png">. For more details about port status indicators, see <a href="#chstatus">Appendix A</a>.</p>

<div>JACK ports can be connected by using the command <code>jack_connect</code>&#160;<cite><a href="#manjack">[6]</a></cite>. To connect the mentioned ports to a pair of system playback ports. the commands would be
<pre><code class="bash">jack_connect 'New session.anja:Master out' 'system:playback_1'
jack_connect 'New session.anja:Audition' 'system:playback_2'
</code></pre>
Then, Anja will use the "Left" channel as main output, and the "Right" channel as Audition.</div>

</info-content></div>


<h4 id="keybstatus"><span class="fill">3.3.3</span>Activating the keyboard</h4><p>Since the keyboard is shared between the playback triggering system and form input fields, playback can only be triggered from the keyboard when keyboard triggering is active. The <dfn>keyboard status indicator</dfn> (see <a href="#statusarea">Section 3.1</a>) is red <img src="led_stop.png" alt="led_stop.png"> when a form input field has keyboard focus, and green <img src="led_ready.png" alt="led_ready.png"> when playback triggering is active. Keyboard triggering is activated by hitting <kbd>ESC</kbd>, or by clicking anywhere on the workspace that would not capture keyboard focus.</p>

<h3 id="rec"><span class="fill">3.4</span>Capturing waveforms</h3><p>Similar to waveform playback (see <a href="#play">Section 3.3</a>), waveform capture requires that the audio engine is started. In order to capture a waveform, make sure that <code>Wave in</code> is connected to a signal source by clicking on the indicator for <code>Wave in</code>. That is, the leftmost indicator in the <dfn>port status area</dfn> (see <a href="#statusarea">Section 3.1</a>). Then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and the typing area key <kbd><var>K</var></kbd> that should be used for playing the captured waveform. If the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> is released before the typing area key, playback of the recorded waveform is triggered. If <kbd><var>K</var></kbd> is released first, the capture process is stoppped.</p>

<h4 id="description"><span class="fill">3.5.2</span>Waveform description</h4><p>It is possible to assign an arbitrary description to the waveform slot through the <ui-formfield>Description</ui-formfield> field. The description does not affect the waveform playback, but makes it easier to find the waveform in the <dfn>Keyboard view</dfn>.</p>

<p>It may happen that the description is long. Therefore it is possible to mark a key-phrase by surrounding it with square brackets. Then, only the text within the first pair of square brackets will appear at the virtual key. If there are no square brackets within the description, the first word will be used instead.</p>

<h4 id="wavecolor"><span class="fill">3.5.3</span>Waveform color</h4><p>Like description (see <a href="#description">Section 3.5.2</a>), the <ui-formfield>Color</ui-formfield> field is only used for visual enhancements. The color is given as red-green-blue-alpha values delimited by <char>;</char>, where each component is in the range [0, 1]. If the <ui-button>…</ui-button> is pressed, a color selection dialog based on the HSL color system appears.</p>

	The idea behind color coding of waveform slots is that slots that are used in similar context can be encoded with a similar color. The color coding feature can be used to categorize different kinds of waveforms such as <var>Fx</var>  and <var>Ambient</var>.

<h4 id="pbchannel"><span class="fill">3.5.4</span>Playback channel</h4><p>The <ui-formfield>Channel</ui-formfield> field assigns a channel to the waveform slot. All sound from this slot will be routed through the selected channel.</p>

	Channels can be used to fade multiple sound sources together. The mix of all channels can either be controlled by the internal <dfn>channel mixer</dfn> (see <a href="#chmixer">Section 3.6</a>), or by an external mixer (see <a href="#multichannel">Section 3.7</a>).

<h4 id="pbgain"><span class="fill">3.5.5</span>Playback gain</h4><p>Before the signal reaches the strip for the selected playback channel (see <a href="#pbchannel">Section 3.5.4</a>), the signal is amplified by the given playback gain. The gain can be adjusted from -72&#160;dB to 6&#160;dB.</p>

<h4 id="pbgainrandom"><span class="fill">3.5.6</span>Playback gain randomization</h4><p>In addition to deterministic playback gain adjustment, it is possible to add a non-deterministic component to the playback gain. The  parameter <ui-formfield>Gain random</ui-formfield> sets how much the random component is amplified.</p>

<div>Depending on the state of the <ui-formfield>Set gain on loop</ui-formfield> flag (see <a href="#pboptgainrand">Section 3.5.7.4</a>), new random numbers are drawn on manual re-triggering, or for each iteration when playback loop is active. This can be useful for creating a more "living" sound.</div>
</info-content></div>

<h4 id="pboptions"><span class="fill">3.5.7</span>Controlling playback behavior</h4><p>There are different options for controlling the playback behavior. These are <dfn>Loop</dfn>, <dfn>Sustain</dfn>, <dfn>Readonly</dfn>, and <dfn>Set gain on loop</dfn>.</p>

<h5 id="pboptloop"><span class="fill">3.5.7.1</span>Loop</h5><p>When <dfn>Loop</dfn> is enabled, playback will start form the <dfn>loop begin cursor </dfn> when the playback position reaches the <dfn>loop end cursor</dfn>, if no stopping event has occurred before that happens. For more information about adjusting cursors, see <a href="#rangeadjust">Section 3.5.8</a>.</p>

<h5 id="pboptsustain"><span class="fill">3.5.7.2</span>Sustain</h5><p>The <dfn>Sustain</dfn> flag controls whether or not a key release event should also send a stop event. When the <dfn>Sustain</dfn> flag is set, a stop event is not sent, emulating the effect of a pushed sustain pedal. </p>

<h5 id="pboptreadonly"><span class="fill">3.5.7.3</span>Readonly</h5><p>The <dfn>Readonly</dfn> flag controls whether or not it is possible to overwrite a loaded waveform with captured audio (see <a href="#rec">Section 3.4</a>). Enabling <dfn>Readonly</dfn> prevents that a loaded waveform is accidentally overwritten by a record command.</p>

<h5 id="pboptgainrand"><span class="fill">3.5.7.4</span>Set gain on loop</h5><p>As mentioned in <a href="#pbgainrandom">Section 3.5.6</a>, it is possible to only randomize gain on the trig event, but it is also possible set a new gain for each iteration in a loop. When this flag is set, the latter happens.</p>

<h4 id="rangeadjust"><span class="fill">3.5.8</span>Adjusting playback or loop range</h4><p>It may happen that only a part of a loaded waveform is interesting for playback or loop. With the <dfn>trim panel</dfn> (see <a href="#trimpanel">Figure 3.7</a>), it is possible to select the part of the waveform that should be played or looped. The graph shows in dB<sub>FS</sub>, the root mean square signal power integrated over 1&#160;ms, as a function of time in seconds. On top of the function graph, there are four cursors showing playback and loop range, as well as the <dfn>auto-trigger threshold level</dfn>. In addition to the plot window, there are four input fields that can be used to set playback cursor positions by entering the corresponding time position in seconds. The leftmost input field <ui-formfield>↦</ui-formfield> sets the <em>begin</em> position. The next input field, <ui-formfield>↪</ui-formfield>, sets the <em>loop begin</em> position. The next two input fields, <ui-formfield>↩</ui-formfield> and <ui-formfield>⇥</ui-formfield>, controls <em>loop end</em> and <em>end</em> respectively. Between the <em>begin</em> part and <em>end</em> section is a toggle button that toggles reversed playback.</p>

Playback starts at the <em>begin</em> cursor and passes the <em>loop begin</em> cursor. When the playback position reaches the <em>loop end</em> cursor, and loop is activated and the engine has not received a stop message, the playback will continue from <em>loop begin</em> when it reaches <em>loop end</em>.

<div>If the <em>loop begin</em> cursor coincides with <em>loop end</em> cursor, the loop range becomes empty and there will be no audible loop.
</div>
</info-content></div>

<h5 id="cursorpositions"><span class="fill">3.5.8.1</span>Setting cursor positions</h5><p>The primary way of setting the position of a cursor is to drag the cursor into position. The position of the <em>begin</em> is controlled by the green solid cursor and the position of the <em>loop begin</em> is controlled by the green dashed cursor. The end cursors are drawn the same way but in red instead of green.</p>

<div class="infobox_info ">

<div>If it is hard to position a cursor sufficiently exact, try pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Shift</kbd> while using the mousewheel. This will zoom in or out in the <var>x</var> or <var>y</var> directions. Dragging inside the plot window, but not near a cursor, will translate the view window. Right-clicking in the plot window will reset the view to its initial state.
</div>
</info-content></div>

<p>Another way of adjusting the cursor positions is to drag the auto-triggering cursor while pressing <kbd>Shift</kbd>. This will move the <em>begin</em> and <em>end</em> cursors to the first or last position where the signal power exceeds the current threshold level. If this requires that the loop cursors to move, they will be pushed by the non-loop cursors.</p>

<div class="infobox_info ">
<info-content>
<picture>
<source srcset="message_info.svg">
<img src="message_info.gif" alt="info">
</picture>
<div>It is possible to use the auto-trigger threshold to set both the playback range and the loop range individually as long as the loop range is set given a higher threshold level. Since the auto-trigger only moves the <em>begin</em> and <em>end</em> cursors, but doing so may push the loop cursors to new positions, it is possible to push the loop cursors inwards to a certain position. When lowering the auto-trigger threshold, the loop cursors stays, but the other cursors move outwards.

<div>If <kbd>Shift</kbd> is not pressed when the auto-triggering cursor is moved, no automatic adjustment is applied. This way, the auto-triggering cursor can be used as a guide for positioning the cursors manually.
</div>
</info-content></div>

<p>A third option is to enter cursors positions into the input fields below the plot window. The leftmost input field <ui-formfield>↦</ui-formfield> sets the <em>begin</em> position. The next input field, <ui-formfield>↪</ui-formfield>, sets the <em>loop begin</em> position. The next two input fields, <ui-formfield>↩</ui-formfield> and <ui-formfield>⇥</ui-formfield>, controls <em>loop end</em> and <em>end</em> respectively.</p>

<h5 id="revplayback"><span class="fill">3.5.8.2</span>Reversed playback</h5><p>Reversed playback is toggled by the middle button in the <dfn>trim panel</dfn> (see <a href="#trimpanel">Figure 3.7</a>). What it does is to swap the direction shown in <a href="#playseq">Figure 3.8</a> by reversing the list of cursor.  Another way of enabling reversed playback is to manually position the <em>end</em> cursors before the <em>begin</em> cursors. When <em>begin</em> and <em>end</em> cursors meats, the reverse toggle button changes state.</p>

<h3 id="chmixer"><span class="fill">3.6</span>Configuring playback channels</h3><p>The <dfn>Channel mixer</dfn> is shown in <a href="#channelmixerfig">Figure 3.9</a>. The <dfn>Channel mixer</dfn> controls the playback volume for the different playback channels. To the right of all channel strips, there is a master gain control, which controls the playback volume of the mixed channels. In addition to a gain control, each channel strip also contains an input field for selecting a channel color, which works similar to the color input field for waveforms (see <a href="#wavecolor">Section 3.5.3</a>), and a control for determining the duration of automatic fade-in/out operations.</p>

	The knob uses an exponential mapping to increase precision for shorter time values. Also, it uses polar coordinates.

<p>Automatic fade-in/out is triggered by hitting <kbd>F<var>k</var></kbd> while pressing <kbd>↑</kbd>/<kbd>↓</kbd>, where <var>k</var> is the channel number. After fade-out, the channel is muted until it is unmuted or a fade-in occures.

<p>When a channel is muted and the engine uses single-channel output, the corresponding indicator in the <dfn>port status area</dfn> (see <a href="#statusarea">Section 3.1</a>), is red <img src="led_stop.png" alt="led_stop.png">. The same is true when the engine uses multi-channel output (see <a href="#multichannel">Section 3.7</a>). In the case the engine uses multi-channel output and the corresponding port is not connected, the muted state is indicated by a black <img src="led_off.png" alt="led_off.png"> indicator. Unmuting the channel, reverts the corresponding indicator to its original state. All possible states of the port status indicators are listed in <a href="#chstatus">Appendix A</a>.</p>


<h3 id="multichannel"><span class="fill">3.7</span>Multi-channel output</h3><p>Anja has the option to use individual channel output. This enables the use of external effect processors on the different channels. To activate this feature, check the checkbox <ui-button>Use individual ports for each channel</ui-button> in the <dfn>session tab</dfn> (see <a href="#sessprops">Section 3.9</a>), and restart the engine by clicking on <ui-button>Start engine</ui-button> in the <dfn>action panel</dfn> (see <a href="#anjaworkspace">Figure 3.2</a>). When individual ports are used for different channels, Anja creates one JACK port for each of the 16 channels in addition to <code>Master out</code> and <code>Audition</code>. These ports are connected in a similar way as described in <a href="#connections">Section 3.3.2</a>, that is by clicking on the corresponding status indicator (see <a href="#statusarea">Section 3.1</a>).</p>

<p>The signal sent to the channel-dedicated output ports are taken after the channel strip, but before the master gain adjustment. When activating multi-channel output, the port status indicators for the playback channels turns yellow <img src="led_wait.png" alt="led_wait.png"> or black <img src="led_off.png" alt="led_off.png"> (depending on mute state) since the corresponding ports are not connected to any input port. However, the signal is still being routed to <code>Master out</code>. For a complete overview of the signal flow, see <a href="#signalflow">Appendix D</a>.

<h3 id="midi"><span class="fill">3.8</span>Using MIDI</h3><p>MIDI is a standard for communications between musical instruments, and other equipment&#160;<cite><a href="#mma">[8]</a></cite>. Through MIDI, Anja can be controlled by other MIDI enabled devices or software applications. To make it work, connect the <code>MIDI in</code> port to any MIDI output port such as <code>midi_capture_1</code>, and Anja will respond to external MIDI messages. Implementation details of different MIDI messages can be found in <a href="#midiref">Appendix E</a>.</p>

<p>Anja can also be used to control other MIDI enabled devices or software applications. To let Anja do so, connect <code>MIDI out</code> to a suitable MIDI input port on the device or software application you want to control. Anja posts the messages generated by the computer keyboard to <code>MIDI out</code>. The messages generated in different situations are listed in <a href="#midiref">Appendix E</a>.</p>

MIDI messages for playing notes are always tagged with a MIDI channel number. In Anja, the MIDI channels are the same as the playback channels (see <a href="#pbchannel">Section 3.5.4</a> and <a href="#chmixer">Section 3.6</a>). Thus, there are two sources for the channel number: the MIDI message itself, and the channel number of the slot referered to by the MIDI message. To resolve this, there is an option <ui-button>Allow external MIDI sources to set playback channel</ui-button> in the <dfn>session tab</dfn> (see <a href="#sessprops">Section 3.9</a>).

When <code>MIDI out</code> is connected to a MIDI input port, Anja resets the state of the receiver, and updates its channel volumes. This means that if the owner of the input port plays any note, there will be no more audio output from that device or software application until the next "note on" message comes.

<h2 id="script"><span class="fill">H</span> Commands accepted in scripts</h2><p>With the <code>--script</code> (see <a href="#cmdline">Appendix F</a>), it is possible to perform some tasks when starting Anja. This option has been added to make it possible to generate relevant screenshots for this manual. This means that only features that are needed for that purpose are currently implemented. Also, the syntax may change in a future release and is not very tolerant with respect to whitespace. Nevertheless, this appendix contains a list of all implemented commands.</p>
